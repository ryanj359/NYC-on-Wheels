        New York City is no stranger to innovative food establishments, with mobile vendors 
        being one of the most historic. From the early pushcarts to today&#39s food trucks, the history
        of street vending runs deep in the city.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the 1800s, immigrant communities introduced pushcarts. Mainly in the Lower East Side of 
        Manhattan, they would sell food amongst eachother, or to workers in the area who either 
        couldn&#39t afford to eat out or didn&#39t have the time to cook at home. This also provided these
        immigrants with a chance to make money and be included in the city's economy.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the early 2000s, food trucks had a comeback; these trucks began selling their takes on 
        traditional street food, as well as new items.
        <br>

        The vendors of today face many challenges, one of which is getting permits. Kelebohile 
        Nkhereanye, a seasoned street vendor and activist, strongly believes that vendors need and 
        deserve their voices heard. "I'm not only a vendor who is on the street selling, I'm a vendor
        who also understands that in order for the city to support vendors, we have to be in 
        different rooms to help." (Nkhereanye)

        The street food culture in New York City today is a myriad of cuisines from all over which 
        is a very accurate reflection of the diverse culture in the city. Vendors continue to play a 
        crucial role in providing affordable and diverse food options, contributing to the city's 
        vibrant food scene. But, they also face ongoing challenges, emphasizing the need for 
        continued advocacy and support.
        <br>
        <br>
        The history of mobile food vendors in New York City is evidence of the city's immigrant 
        heritage and entrepreneurial spirit. As the city continues to evolve and grow, so will its 
        street food culture.
