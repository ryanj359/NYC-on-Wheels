            New York City is no stranger to innovative food establishments, with mobile vendors 
            being one of the most historic. From the early pushcarts to today&#39s food trucks, 
            the history of street vending runs deep in the city.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the 1800s, immigrant communities introduced pushcarts. Mainly in the Lower East 
            Side of Manhattan, they would sell food amongst each other, or to workers in the area 
            who either couldn&#39t afford to eat out or didn&#39t have the time to cook at home. This 
            also provided these immigrants with a chance to make money and be included in the 
            city's economy.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the early 2000s, food trucks made a comeback; these trucks began selling their takes 
            on traditional street food, as well as new items.
            <br>
            <br>
            The vendors of today face many challenges, one of which is getting permits. Obtaining a 
            permit requires a great deal of patience; the city only offers a limited amount of permits 
            each year, so even after submitting applications, completing courses, and paying fees, you 
            still are not guaranteed a permit right away. Kelebohile Nkhereanye, a seasoned street 
            vendor and activist, strongly believes that vendors need and deserve their voices heard. 
            "I'm not only a vendor who is on the street selling, I'm a vendor who also understands 
            that in order for the city to support vendors, we have to be in different rooms to help,‚Äù 
            says Nkhereanye.

            The street food culture in New York City today is a myriad of cuisines from all over, 
            which is a very accurate reflection of the diverse culture in the city. Vendors continue 
            to play a crucial role in providing affordable and diverse food options, contributing to 
            the city's vibrant food scene. But, they also face ongoing challenges, emphasizing the 
            need for continued advocacy and support.
            <br>
            <br>
            The history of mobile food vendors in New York City is evidence of the city's immigrant 
            heritage and entrepreneurial spirit. As the city continues to evolve and grow, so will 
            its street food culture.
