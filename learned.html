    <p class="learnedBody">
        After living here four years, give or take, I&#39ve learned a lot about this city. 
        I&#39ve learned which streets I prefer to cross at. I&#39ve learned the parks I love to 
        walk through. I&#39ve learned which bus routes get me where I need to go, and which 
        ones say they&#39ll show up and never do. I&#39ve learned how to be alone, and how to 
        be okay with being alone. I&#39ve simultaneously learned that you&#39re never really 
        alone here. I&#39ve learned that talking to strangers can be the most interesting 
        part of your month. I&#39ve learned that knowing the bar tenders and bouncers at the 
        bar down the street can almost make it feel like you live in a doorman building, at 
        least on the weekends. I&#39ve learned that getting to know your local deli guy or 
        barista will give you a sense of home. I&#39ve learned that having support is one of 
        the best feelings in the world, and so is knowing someone has yours. I&#39ve learned 
        that dating is the worst, but fun when you can laugh about it with your friends. 
        I&#39ve learned that my people means everything to me. And from this project, I&#39ve 
        learned that community is one of the most necessary things in life.
