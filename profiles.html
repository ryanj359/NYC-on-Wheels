                    Birria-Landia is a truck that is hard to miss. Whether you&#39re on the Upper West Side, 
                    in Brooklyn, in Queens, on the Lower East Side, or in the Bronx, you&#39ll easily spot 
                    the red and white trucks, plastered with images of birria tacos and a rotating 
                    multi-colored LED sign reading, “Welcome to Birria-Landia,” Tijuana style … tacos …,” 
                    and more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the Lower East Side, the truck is located on the corner of East Houston Street and 
                    Bowery; a lively intersection in the heart of lower Manhattan. There is a constant 
                    shuffle of people around the truck, whether it is those who work on it, those passing 
                    by, or those wanting to order. José Moreno is a part of that shuffle.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    José Moreno is one of the two founders of Birria-Landia, the other being his brother 
                    Jesús. The inspiration for Birria-Landia came from José&#39s friends in Tijuana, Mexico 
                    and this inspiration was put into action in the fall of 2019 in Jackson Heights where 
                    the Moreno brothers opened their first food truck.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “A lot of people don't trust food trucks. They think it's not clean, “did you wash your 
                    hands?” They think it's not enough and a lot of people have this concept.” (Moreno)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the past five, going on six years, Moreno has run into plenty of challenges himself, 
                    such as permitting, parking, and neighborhood complaints. Although his neighbors may 
                    complain about his truck taking up too much space, or attracting a crowd, Moreno has 
                    always kept them in mind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “I serve good food at a good price. In my mind, food is something that you have to 
                    buy every day, it doesn't matter what. When you buy a nice hat or nice clothing, 
                    you can wait this month and buy it next month. But food, you cannot buy food only 
                    when you want… If I raise my prices, I get to make a little more money at that moment, 
                    but that customer won&#39t continue to come.” (Moreno)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There is also a strong bond between Moreno&#39s truck and the other vendors in the area. 
                    Birria-Landia worked with Tom and Jerry&#39s, a bar in the Lower East Side; Birria-Landia 
                    donated 150 tacos for an event that Tom and Jerry&#39s was hosting and in return, José and 
                    his employees has been offered bathroom access whenevery they need it. As well as this,
                     they have a special relationship with a local pizza shop. “When they want tacos they 
                     can pick it out and when we want pizza we go there. They don't charge for the pizza, 
                     we don't charge them for the tacos.” (Moreno)
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Birria-Landia has worked to create not only a strong and loyal customer base, 
                     but a mutually beneficial relationship with those who they share a block with. This 
                     would be hard feat if this business did not have such a compassionate and caring owner 
                     like José.

                Hope Morawa, the host of the evening, sits at one end of the bar with her 
                face hidden behind a laptop, microphone in hand. The tables are filled with small 
                groups of people huddled around their phones, figuring out what to send in as their 
                trivia answer. The whir of the frozen drink machines and murmurs of people contemplating 
                their answers fills the room as the smell of freshly made tacos floats in from outside. 
                Greg Fusco, one of the managers, moves back and forth behind the bar serving drinks with 
                a side of light conversation. 
                <br>
                <br>
                If you go to the corner of Franklin Avenue and Clifton Place in Bedstuy, Brooklyn, 
                you won&#39t see a food truck; you&#39ll see a convenience store, a deli, some construction, 
                and a black store front accompanied by a funky mural. A small LED sign will tell you this 
                is Chilo&#39s.
                <br>
                <br>
                In case you missed it, yes I did say Chilo&#39s has a store front. This is actually a 
                brick-and-mortar bar but, it has a special surprise outback. After you pass through the bar, 
                a sign that says “tacos” will guide you to an outdoor area filled with tables, string lights, 
                and most importantly, a taco truck.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lev Gewirtzman and Jacques Belanger opened Chilo&#39s in 2015 with a heavy inspiration from 
                the food trucks parked in Sunset Park. They wanted to have the feeling of a bar restaurant 
                with things such as indoor seating and TVs for sports, but still wanted to incorporate the 
                feeling of an authentic taco truck. So, they did just that; they combined the two by putting 
                a stationary food truck in the back of the bar.
                <br>
                <br>
                “I think the biggest benefit of a food truck, as opposed to restaurant is that we 
                don't have servers… you have to interact with the person in the truck. You're gonna interact 
                with other people that are waiting for their food or you're gonna interact with the bartender 
                that's taking your order… I think all food trucks kind of have that sense of community where you 
                have those interactions that are real, human interactions.” (Fusco)
                <br>
                <br>
                After being open for 10 years, Chilo&#39s has had some hard times, the biggest being the effects 
                of Covid. “We've seen a lot of establishments close down and have a lot of issues. It's always 
                kind of rough coming back from something like that; it&#39s the first time we've all ever had to 
                deal with something like that.” (Fusco)
                <br>
                <br>
                Fusco explained that post-Covid he noticed a major decrease in the amount of people who were 
                going out. Because of this, he and Devin Ayers, a manager as well, have been working to bring 
                the community back together. “Something that&#39s been hard, and we've worked very hard to recreate 
                and rebuild, is that that that bar community.” (Fusco)
                <br>
                <br>
                One way Chilo&#39s has worked towards rebuilding this community is by implementing weekly trivia 
                nights every Monday at 8 PM, hosted by Hope. They also have board games in the back of the bar, 
                host bingo nights in the summer on the outdoor patio, and have TVs inside where people can come 
                enjoy a sports game.
                <br>
                <br>
                “It's a bar with a food truck; everyone comes and they just chill together… It's all about community 
                and it's nice that people still want to come out and be involved in that.” (Ayers)

                In 2001 Washington Sqaure Park was blessed with an absolute staple; Thiru Kumar opened 
                NY Dosas, “the first vegan dosa card in the world.” (Kumar) 
                <br>
                <br>
                Kumar initially wanted to open his cart at The World Trade Center, but due to 
                unforeseen events it wasn&#39t possible. His second choice was somewhere near a college, 
                and at Washingston Sqaure Park he can still see his first choice. Kumar chose to be on 
                the south side of the park, right inside he entrance at Sullivan Street and Washington Sqaure 
                South. “I wanted to do it on the outside for people to see what&#39s cooking. For me, personally, 
                I like to see my food and how it's cooked, you know, very picky.” (Kumar)
                <br>
                <br>
                NY Dosas sells a number of different vegetarian dishes, all for under $11. Affordaibility 
                is an integral part of NY Dosas; Kumar understands that people who are strictly vegan and 
                vegetarian need lots of protein, which can be hard to come by at a decent price. “I keep the 
                price low because I want everyone to enjoy the food; poor people, rich people, a job, no job, 
                anybody can come and have good, healthy food.” (Kumar)
                <br>
                <br>
                Kumar also works to educate the community on the South Indian cuisine. “A lot of volunteers 
                and a lot of friends came and helped me out in the beginning, because a lot of people in New 
                York don&#39t know what dosa is. So even from the students and people who live in the neighborhood, 
                whoever passes by, we make a sample and give it to them and then explain what is dosa and where is 
                the dosa is from.” (Kuamr)
                <br>
                <br>
                Since the cart is in the heart of New York University&#39s “campus” so-to-say, college students 
                have become fairly reliant on Kumar&#39s affordable, healthy food. So much so, that Kumar has even 
                taught some kids how they can make his food at home.
                <br>
                <br>
                NY Dosas is a vital part of the street food world in New York City. Kumar helps those 
                around him by providing affordable, healthy food while simultaniously teaching people about a 
                culture they might not be as aware of. He has created his strong community by being consistent and 
                staying true to his word.
                <br>
                <br>
                “Ever since I opened 23 years ago, it's still $1 water.” (Kumar)

                If you find yourself in Park Slope, Brooklyn, on Fifth Avenue and Ninth Street, 
                and you see a bright blue truck that reads “Up a Notch” on the side, I recommend making 
                a stop.
                <br>
                <br>
                This truck is owned by Ahmend and his father who both have a strong passion for cooking. 
                There are an abundance of halal carts in New York City, and Ahmed and his father noticed 
                that they&#39re all pretty similar. “We noticed that halal food specifically has been pretty 
                standard everywhere. Everyone does it the same, it&#39s pretty consistent everywhere you go. 
                I mean, some places are better than others, but we want to be better.” (Ahmed) So, they 
                wanted to take it, well, up a notch.
                <br>
                <br>
                Opening just over a year ago, Up a Notch sells a myriad of different things. They have the 
                standard halal plates like chicken over rice, lamb over rice, etcetera but, they also have 
                smash burgers, chopped cheeses, hot dogs, cheesesteaks, and more. What makes Up a Notch 
                stand out more than this, is their use of fresh ingredients.
                <br>
                <br>
                “The concept was always that we want to be better than everyone else. Well, not everyone 
                else, but the concept of the being great. So, if we're gonna do cheese steaks, we're not 
                using that frozen stuff. Most places that make cheese steaks, it's usually frozen meat. 
                We're like, No…if we're going to do this, we have to do everything fresh, and it has to be 
                fresh on a daily basis.” (Ahmed)
                <br>
                <br>
                Having been born and raised in New York City, Ahmed is no stranger to a food truck, “they 
                have always been a staple in New York City.” (Ahmed) From this, he knew how he wanted to 
                treat his clientele.
                <br>
                <br>
                “We try to make the interaction between us and the client more than just, “hey, what would 
                you like to eat? Cost $10. Have a great day.” No. “Hey, how's your day?” “How's your father?”
                 “How's your kids?” you know, build that relationship with them so that there's this sense 
                 of community. For example, “you usually come by here with your father. Where's your father 
                 to not feeling well?” Well, now we know that their dad's not feeling well and we let the 
                 community know, “hey, X, Y and Z&#39s, father&#39s not feeling well. You should probably call.” 
                 Stuff like that, you know what I mean? We're trying to build that bond with the community.”
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 “I think, generally speaking, that's what food vendors in our city do that's what makes 
                 food vending in the streets, you know, pretty special.” (Ahmed)
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 And so, on a warm spring Sunday night, I found myself in Park Slope, Brooklyn - on the 
                 corner of Fifth Avenue and Ninth Street to be exact - and a bright blue truck caught my eye.
                “Up a Notch” it read on the side. As I read the name I remembered a friend of mine had 
                recommended I come here as it&#39s her favorite food truck in the neighborhood. Sophie Welles,
                said friend, I cannot thank you enough as you just introduced me to one of the best smash
                burgers I have ever had.

                In the Diamond District of Manhattan, past the rush of Sixth Avenue on West 46th St, 
                stuck between a different food truck and, when I was there, a maintenance van, you&#39ll 
                find Moshe&#39s Falafel.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moshe, and immigrant from Israel, started selling his food on 46th Street in 1981 and has 
                continued to grow his business since then. David, a manager, gave me the rundown on the 
                menu. At this Kosher, vegetarian, and vegan restaurant there&#39s vegetable soups, cauliflower 
                shawarma, “perfect hummus” (David), falafel and more. “We give the same food that we gave 
                since 1981. It's never changed. The falafel never changed. The taste never changed.” (David)
                <br>
                <br>
                Being in such a busy area for so long, Moshe&#39s has created a very loyal customer base over 
                the years inlcuidng people who work around there as well as passersby. I got a taste of this 
                as I was there when a woman waiting for her food sparked up light conversation with me. 
                Although I never got her name, as she was walking away she said, “the wait is worth it, this 
                is my favorite place.”
                <br>
                <br>
                Having been in the mobile food vending industry for so long, David has noticed an increase 
                in the number of carts and trucks in the city. “You have all kinds of food to choose from 
                and today, you have it on wheels.” (David)
                <br>
                <br>
                Although there has been an overall increase in mobile vendors in the city, there are still 
                very few kosher mobile vendors, so they all help eachother out. “Sometimes there are events 
                that somebody cannot do. Let&#39s say someone needs kosher ice cream, we call the guy with the 
                kosher ice cream and tell him there is an event and they they need kosher ice cream there, 
                please show up. We call if we have someone in mind.” (David)
                <br>
                <br>
                Along with helping eachother out, the food truck community will come together and do events
                together when more man power is needed. Moshe&#39s has done collaborative events for Columbia
                University, Google, and Goldman Sachs just to name a few.

                “We give to good people and these people like it, so we need to keep going. If it's going 
                good, we're gonna go with it.” (David)
