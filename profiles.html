        <p class="profileBody">
            Birria-Landia is a truck that is hard to miss. Whether you&#39re on the Upper West Side, 
            in Brooklyn, in Queens, on the Lower East Side, or in the Bronx, you&#39ll easily spot the 
            red and white trucks plastered with images of birria tacos and a rotating multi-colored 
            LED sign reading, “Welcome to Birria-Landia Tijuana style … tacos …,” and more.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the Lower East Side, the truck is located on the corner of East Houston Street and 
            Bowery, a lively intersection in the heart of lower Manhattan. There is a constant shuffle 
            of people around the truck, whether it is those who work on it, those passing by, or those 
            wanting to order. José Moreno is a part of that shuffle.
            <br>
            <br>
            José Moreno is one of the two founders of Birria-Landia, the other being his brother Jesús. 
            The inspiration for Birria-Landia came from José&#39s friends in Tijuana, Mexico &#8211 and this 
            inspiration was put into action in the fall of 2019 in Jackson Heights, where the Moreno 
            brothers opened their first food truck.
            <br>
            <br>
            “A lot of people don't trust food trucks. They think it's not clean, &#39did you wash your hands?&#39 
            says Moreno.
            <br>
            <br>
            Over the past five, going on six, years, Moreno has run into plenty of challenges, such as permitting, 
            parking, and neighborhood complaints. Although some of his neighbors may complain about his truck 
            taking up too much space, or attracting a crowd, others are his regular customers &#8211 and Moreno has 
            always kept them in mind.
            <br>
            <br>
            “I serve good food at a good price. In my mind, food is something that you have to buy every day, 
            it doesn't matter what. When you buy a nice hat or nice clothing, you can wait this month and buy 
            it next month. But food, you cannot buy food only when you want… If I raise my prices, I get to make 
            a little more money at that moment, but that customer won&#39t continue to come,” he says.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is also a strong bond between Moreno&#39s truck and the other vendors in the area. Birria-Landia 
            donated 150 tacos for an event that Tom and Jerry&#39s, a bar in the Lower East Side, hosted &#8211 and in return, 
            José and his employees have been offered bathroom access whenever they need it. Birria Landia also have a 
            special relationship with a local pizza shop. “When they want tacos, they can pick it out and when we want 
            pizza, we go there. They don't charge for the pizza, we don't charge them for the tacos,” says Moreno.
            <br>
            <br>
            Birria-Landia has worked to create not only a strong and loyal customer base, but a mutually beneficial 
            relationship with those who they share a block with. This would be hard feat if this business did not 
            have such a compassionate and caring owner like José.

        <p class="profileBody">
            Hope Morawa, the host of the evening, sits at one end of the bar with her face hidden behind a laptop, 
            microphone in hand. The tables are filled with small groups of people huddled around their phones, figuring 
            out what to send in as their trivia answer. The whir of the frozen drink machines and murmurs of people 
            contemplating their answers fills the room as the smell of freshly made tacos floats in from outside. 
            Greg Fusco, one of the managers, moves back and forth behind the bar serving drinks with a side of light 
            conversation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If you go to the corner of Franklin Avenue and Clifton Place in Bedstuy, Brooklyn, you won&#39t see a 
            food truck; you&#39ll see a convenience store, a deli, some construction, and a black storefront accompanied 
            by a funky mural. A small LED sign will tell you this is Chilo&#39s.
            <br>
            <br>
            In case you missed it, yes, I did say Chilo&#39s has a store front. This is actually a brick-and-mortar bar &#8211 but 
            it has a special surprise out back. After you pass through the bar, a sign that says “tacos” will guide you 
            to an outdoor area filled with tables, string lights, and most importantly, a taco truck.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lev Gewirtzman and Jacques Belanger opened Chilo&#39s in 2015 with a heavy inspiration from the food trucks parked 
            in Sunset Park. They wanted to have the feeling of a bar restaurant with things such as indoor seating and TVs for 
            sports, but still wanted to incorporate the feeling of an authentic taco truck. So, they did just that; they combined 
            the two by putting a stationary food truck in the back of the bar.
            <br>
            <br>
            “I think the biggest benefit of a food truck, as opposed to [a] restaurant, is that we don't have servers…you have 
            to interact with the person in the truck. You're gonna interact with other people that are waiting for their food or 
            you're gonna interact with the bartender that's taking your order… I think all food trucks kind of have that sense of 
            community where you have those interactions that are real, human interactions,” says Fusco.
            <br>
            <br>
            After being open for 10 years, Chilo&#39s has had some hard times, the biggest being the effects of Covid. “We've seen a 
            lot of establishments close down and have a lot of issues. It's always kind of rough coming back from something like 
            that; it's the first time we've all ever had to deal with something like that,” Fusco says.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fusco explained that post-Covid, he noticed a major decrease in the amount of people who were going out. Because of 
            this, he and Devin Ayers, a manager as well, have been working to bring the community back together. “Something that's 
            been hard, and we've worked very hard to recreate and rebuild, is that bar community, ” says Fusco.
            <br>
            <br>
            One way Chilo&#39s has worked towards rebuilding this community is by implementing weekly trivia nights every Monday at 8 PM, 
            hosted by Hope. They also have board games in the back of the bar, host bingo nights in the summer on the outdoor patio, 
            and have TVs inside where people can come enjoy a sports game.
            <br>
            <br>
            “It's a bar with a food truck; everyone comes and they just chill together…It's all about community and it's nice that 
            people still want to come out and be involved in that,” says Ayers.

        <br>
        <p class="profileBody">
            In 2001, Washington Square Park was blessed with an absolute staple when Thiru Kumar opened NY Dosas, “the first 
            vegan dosa cart in the world,” Kumar says. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Kumar initially wanted to open his cart at The World Trade Center, but due to unforeseen events it wasn&#39t possible. 
            His second choice was somewhere near a college, and at Washington Square Park, he can still see his first choice 
            towering in the distance. Kumar chose to be on the south side of the park, right inside the entrance at Sullivan 
            Street and Washington Square South. “I wanted to do it on the outside for people to see what&#39s cooking. For me, personally, 
            I like to see my food and how it's cooked &#8211 [I&#39m] very picky,” he says.
            <br>
            <br>
            NY Dosas sells a number of different vegetarian dishes, all for under $11. Affordability is an integral part of NY 
            Dosas; Kumar understands that people who are strictly vegan and vegetarian need lots of protein, which can be hard to 
            come by at a decent price. “I keep the price low because I want everyone to enjoy the food; poor people, rich people, 
            a job, no job, anybody can come and have good, healthy food,” says Kumar.
            <br>
            <br>
            Kumar also works to educate the community on the South Indian cuisine. “A lot of volunteers and a lot of friends 
            came and helped me out in the beginning, because a lot of people in New York don&#39t know what dosa is. So even from 
            the students and people who live in the neighborhood, whoever passes by, we make a sample and give it to them and 
            then explain what is dosa and where the dosa is from,” he says.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since the cart is in the heart of New York University&#39s “campus” so-to-say, college students have become fairly 
            reliant on Kumar&#39s affordable, healthy food. So much so that Kumar has even taught some kids how they can make his 
            food at home.
            <br>
            <br>
            NY Dosas is a vital part of the street food world in New York City. Kumar helps those around him by providing 
            affordable, healthy food while simultaneously teaching people about a culture they might not be as aware of. He 
            has created his strong community by being consistent and staying true to his word.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Ever since I opened 23 years ago, it's still $1 water,” says Kumar.

        <p id="notch" class="profileTitle"> Up a Notch </p>
        <br>
        <p class="profileBody">
            If you find yourself in Park Slope, Brooklyn, on Fifth Avenue and Ninth Street, and you see a bright blue 
            truck that reads “Up a Notch” on the side, I recommend making a stop.
            <br>
            <br>
            This truck is owned by Ahmend and his father, who both have a strong passion for cooking. There are an abundance 
            of halal carts in New York City, and Ahmed and his father noticed that they&#39re all pretty similar. “We noticed 
            that halal food specifically has been pretty standard everywhere. Everyone does it the same, it&#39s pretty 
            consistent everywhere you go. I mean, some places are better than others, but we want to be better,” says 
            Ahmed. So, they wanted to take it, well, <i> up a notch</i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Opening just over a year ago, Up a Notch sells a myriad of different things. They have the standard halal 
            plates like chicken over rice, lamb over rice, etcetera &#8211 but they also have smash burgers, chopped cheeses, 
            hot dogs, cheesesteaks, and more. What makes Up a Notch stand out more than their menu is their use of fresh 
            ingredients.
            <br>
            <br>
            “The concept was always that we want to be better than everyone else. Well, not everyone else, but the concept 
            of being great. So, if we're gonna do cheese steaks, we're not using that frozen stuff. Most places that make 
            cheese steaks, it's usually frozen meat. We're like, &#39No…if we're going to do this, we have to do everything 
            fresh, and it has to be fresh on a daily basis,’” says Ahmed.
            <br>
            <br>
            Having been born and raised in New York City, Ahmed is no stranger to a food truck, “they have always been a staple 
            in New York City,” he says. From this, he knew how he wanted to treat his clientele.
            <br>
            <br>
            “We try to make the interaction between us and the client more than just, &#39hey, what would you like to eat? Cost $10. 
            Have a great day.,&#39 Ahmed says. “No.&#39Hey, how's your day?,&#39 &#39How's your father?,&#39 &#39How's your kids?&#39 &#8211 you know, 
            build that relationship with them so that there's this sense of community. For example, &#39you usually come by here with 
            your father. Where's your father, not feeling too well?&#39 Well, now we know that their dad's not feeling well and we 
            let the community know, &#39hey, X, Y and Z&#39s, father&#39s not feeling well. You should probably call.&#39 Stuff like that, you 
            know what I mean? We're trying to build that bond with the community.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “I think, generally speaking, that's what food vendors in our city do, that's what makes food vending in the streets, 
            you know, pretty special,” says Ahmed.

        <p id="moshes" class="profileTitle"> Moshe's Falafel </p>
        <br>
        <p class="profileBody">
            In the Diamond District of Manhattan, past the rush of Sixth Avenue on West 46th St, stuck between another food 
            truck and, when I was there, a maintenance van, you&#39ll find Moshe&#39s Falafel.
            <br>
            <br>
            Moshe, an immigrant from Israel, started selling his food on 46th Street in 1981 and has continued to grow his business 
            since then. David, a manager at the truck, gave me the rundown on the menu. At this Kosher, vegetarian, and vegan 
            restaurant there are vegetable soups, cauliflower shawarma, “perfect hummus”, falafel, and more. “We give the same food 
            that we gave since 1981. It's never changed. The falafel never changed. The taste never changed,” says David.
            <br>
            <br>
            Being in such a busy area for so long, Moshe&#39s has created a very loyal customer base over the years, including people 
            who work around there, as well as passersby. I got a taste of this as I was there when a woman waiting for her food sparked 
            up light conversation with me. Although I never got her name, as she was walking away she said, “the wait is worth it, 
            this is my favorite place.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Having been in the mobile food vending industry for so long, David has noticed an increase in the number of carts and 
            trucks in the city. “You have all kinds of food to choose from and today, you have it on wheels,” he says.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although there has been an overall increase in mobile vendors in the city, there are still very few kosher mobile vendors, 
            so they all help each other out. “Sometimes there are events that somebody cannot do. Let&#39s say someone needs kosher ice 
            cream, we call the guy with the kosher ice cream and tell him there is an event and they need kosher ice cream there, please 
            show up. We call if we have someone in mind,” says David.
            <br>
            <br>
            Along with helping each other out, the food truck community will come together and do events together when more man power 
            is needed. Moshe&#39s has done collaborative events with other food trucks for Columbia University, Google, and Goldman Sachs 
            just to name a few.
            <br>  
            <br>
            “We give to good people and these people like it, so we need to keep going. If it's going good, we're gonna go with it,” 
            says David.
